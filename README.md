# !Spill
!spill is designed to prevent spills by automatically stopping the flow of liquid when a cup is full. Itâ€™s especially beneficial for visually impaired individuals and children, providing greater independence and reducing the risk of accidents. 

This repository contains the Arduino Code for implementing the !Spill system, consisting of a mug and jug.
